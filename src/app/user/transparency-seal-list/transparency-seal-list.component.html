      <h1 class="mb-3">TESDA MIMAROPA TRANSPARENCY SEAL</h1>
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        A Transparency Seal, prominently displayed on the main page of the
        website of a particular government agency, is a certificate that it has
        complied with the requirements of Section 93. This Seal links to a page
        within the agency’s website which contains an index of downloadable
        items of each of the above-mentioned documents.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Symbolism:</strong> A pearl buried inside a tightly-shut shell
        is practically worthless. Government information is a pearl, meant to be
        shared with the public in order to maximize its inherent value. The
        Transparency Seal, depicted by a pearl shining out of an open shell, is
        a symbol of a policy shift towards openness in access to government
        information. On the one hand, it hopes to inspire Filipinos in the civil
        service to be more open to citizen engagement; on the other, to invite
        the Filipino citizenry to exercise their right to participate in
        governance. This initiative is envisioned as a step in the right
        direction towards solidifying the position of the Philippines as the
        Pearl of the Orient – a shining example for democratic virtue in the
        region. <br /><br />
        <strong>TUV SUD Certificate – MIMAROPA TESDA:</strong> Compliance with
        Sec. 93 of the General Appropriations Act of 2013 (R.A. No. 10352). The
        agency’s mandates and functions, names of its officials with their
        position and designation, and contact information.
