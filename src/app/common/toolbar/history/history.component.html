  <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-6">Our Beginning</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    The <strong>Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA)</strong> was created by 
    <strong>Republic Act No. 7796</strong>, also known as the 
    <em>“Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994.”</em>
    This landmark legislation was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on August 25, 1994.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    The Act unified and integrated the functions of three major government agencies involved in technical-vocational education and skills development:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
    <li>National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)</li>
    <li>Bureau of Technical-Vocational Education (BTVE) of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS)</li>
    <li>Office of Apprenticeship of the DOLE</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-6">Our Mandate</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    TESDA serves as the government agency responsible for managing and supervising 
    technical education and skills development (TESD) in the Philippines. Its mission 
    is to promote and strengthen the quality and relevance of technical-vocational 
    education and training to meet labor market demands both locally and internationally.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Under its mandate, TESDA performs the following key functions:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
    <li>Integrate, coordinate, and monitor skills development programs nationwide.</li>
    <li>Develop and implement competency standards and training regulations.</li>
    <li>Accredit institutions and assessors for training and certification.</li>
    <li>Administer the Philippine TVET Qualification and Certification System.</li>
    <li>Support trainers’ development and industry partnerships for skills innovation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-6">
    Today, TESDA continues to lead the way in building a globally competitive and 
    skilled Filipino workforce—empowering individuals and communities through lifelong learning 
    and employment opportunities.
